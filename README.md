Using API (Application Programming Interface) to fetch news from various sources.

## User Stories

The following **required** functionalities are completed (this is a sample):

* [x] The user can see a list of the 20 latest top news stories, loaded dynamically from newsapi.
* [x] For each story, the user sees a headline, the source, a link to more, and an image.
* [x] The user can see the total number of stories currently shown.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] The user can click a link at the bottom of the page to load the next 20 stories. The page should not refresh; the stories should simply be added to the bottom.
* [ ] The user can see an updated number of stories currently shown.
* [ ] The user can see how long ago the story was published in a human-friendly format; e.g. "15 minutes ago". To accomplish this, we recommend you use momentjs. Please load it into your page using cdnjs or jsdelivr (these are called CDNs).

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [] List anything else that you can get done to improve the page!
